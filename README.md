## Remarks

Tried to turn my cv into a webpage, can click this link for the pdf.

pdf of cv link: [https://github.com/afifdanial99/myResumeWebPage/blob/master/Resume%20Web%20page%20with%20ReactJS.pdf]

The webpage is deployed using vercel app. Please click the link below to visit the webpage.

webpage of cv: [https://my-resume-web-page-85j2va4y6-afifdanial99.vercel.app/.]

Honestly, I could make this webpage better with cleaner code and responsive design but I need to learn more about html/css/reactjs. This is my first time using reactJs so it takes time to learn about it for a while.

Since this webpage is unresponsive, with the wrong ratio screensize can cause the layout of the webpage to be messy. There also extra white space on the right side and on the bottom, I had try to remove it but it could take some time during this process of learning. My first diagnosis to solve the issue is to edit the position, padding, size of element of the webpage in the css.

### Prerequisites

* to install the react-router-dom
  ```sh
  npm install react-router-dom
  ```
  
  * to install icon on the webpage
  ```sh
  npm install react-icons
  ```
  
   * run a website on localhost
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
